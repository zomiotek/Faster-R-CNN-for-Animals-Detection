# Backbone base class, for wrapping backbone models that provide feature
# extraction and pooled feature reduction layers from the classifier
# stages.
#
# The backbone in Faster R-CNN is used in two places:
#
#   1. In Stage 1 as the feature extractor. Given an input image, a feature map
#      is produced that is then passed into both the RPN and detector stages.
#   2. In Stage 3, the detector, proposal regions are pooled and cropped from
#      the feature map (to produce RoIs) and fed into the detector layers,
#      which perform classification and bounding box regression. Each RoI must
#      first be converted into a linear feature vector. With VGG-16, for
#      example, the fully-connected layers following the convolutional layers
#      and preceding the classifier layer, are used to do this.

    Computes the shape of the feature extractor output given an input image

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_shape : Tuple[int, int, int]
      Shape of the input image, (channels, height, width). Only the last two
      dimensions are relevant, allowing image_shape to be either the shape
      of a single image or the entire batch.
