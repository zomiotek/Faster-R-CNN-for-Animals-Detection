  Generates maps defining the anchors for a given input image size. There are 9

  ----------
  image_shape : Tuple[int, int, int]
    Shape of the input image, (channels, height, width), at the scale it will
    be passed into the Faster R-CNN model.
  feature_map_shape : Tuple[int, int, int]
    Shape of the output feature map, (channels, height, width).
  feature_pixels : int
    Distance in pixels between anchors. This is the size, in input image space,

      2. A map of shape (height, width, num_anchors) indicating which anchors
         are valid (1) or invalid (0). Invalid anchors are those that cross
