    Computes feature map shape given input image shape. Unlike VGG-16, ResNet
    convolutional layers use padding and the resultant dimensions are therefore
    not simply an integral division by 16. The calculation here works well
    enough but it is not guaranteed that the simple conversion of feature map
    coordinates to input image pixel coordinates in anchors.py is absolutely
    correct.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_shape : Tuple[int, int, int]
      Shape of the input image, (channels, height, width). Only the last two
      dimensions are relevant, allowing image_shape to be either the shape
      of a single image or the entire batch.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[int, int, int]
      Shape of the feature map produced by the feature extractor,
      (feature_map_channels, feature_map_height, feature_map_width).
