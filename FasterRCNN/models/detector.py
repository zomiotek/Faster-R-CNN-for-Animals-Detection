    Predict final class and box delta regressions for region-of-interest
    proposals. The proposals serve as "anchors" for the box deltas, which
    refine the proposals into final boxes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_map : torch.Tensor
      Feature map of shape (batch_size, feature_map_channels, height, width).
    proposals : torch.Tensor
      Region-of-interest box proposals that are likely to contain objects.
      Has shape (N, 4), where N is the number of proposals, with each box given
      as (y1, x1, y2, x2) in pixel coordinates.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor
      Predicted classes, (N, num_classes), encoded as a one-hot vector, and
      predicted box delta regressions, (N, 4*(num_classes-1)), where the deltas
      are expressed as (ty, tx, th, tw) and are relative to each corresponding
      proposal box. Because there is no box for the background class 0, it is
      excluded entirely and only (num_classes-1) sets of box delta targets are
      computed.
